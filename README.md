In the PID Tuning tab under the "PID Profile Setting" tab 

Not the Rate profile tab.. 

On the right side there Box that says 
"Throttle and Motor Settings
" Change the " Motor Output Limit" to 75 percent. 

______________________________________
Then in the Rate profile tab:
Change your Throttle mid to 0 and Throttle expo to 0. 

This setting can only be set if you know what your throttle value is while hovering. 

Final notes
See how that goes. 
The motor output set to 75 percent will reduce the KV of the motors basically slowing them down.
